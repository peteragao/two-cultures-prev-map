# Code for "The Two Cultures of Prevalence Mapping: Small Area Estimation and Model-Based Geostatistics"

## Introduction

All code is written in R and uses packages available on CRAN. The testing version of INLA needs to be downloaded from <https://www.r-inla.org/download-install> and installed.

The paper reviews methods for estimating prevalences at the subnational level. This repository contains the code for a case study involving estimation of HIV prevalence among women aged 15â€“49 in Zambia, based on household survey data from the Zambia 2018 Demographic Health Survey.

## HIV prevalence in Zambia, 2018

We compare and contrast small area estimation and model-based geostatistics approaches using data from the 2018 Zambia DHS to estimate HIV prevalence among women aged 15-49. In our example, we characterize variation across 10 provinces (Admin-1 areas) and 72 districts (Admin-2 areas) of Zambia, based on the 2018 Demographic Health Survey (DHS), which used stratified (by urban/rural status crossed with Admin-1 area) two-stage cluster sampling.

### Code
